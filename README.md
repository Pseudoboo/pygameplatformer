================

I have used python a handful of times in the past, but not a lot. My main languages are C++, Java, and C#, so this is a project to learn about using python, git, and github. The reason I started this project is because I volunteer at an elementary school as a mentor for a child. When he found out that I was a software engineer professionally, he asked me excitedly if I could make video games, I told him sure, and so, without doing much research, I figure that python and pygame are probably the fastest way to make a small mockup of the game he described to me.
